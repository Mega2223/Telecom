# Telecom

An (WIP) Lua implementation of a routing structure using a distributed systems approach

## About

Telecom is a lua implementation of a adaptable and scalable routing network that aims to provide a routing service to a number of clients.  

It's made with [CC Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked)'s modem API in mind, however due to the modular class structure, you can wrap the algorithms around another framework with minor changes to the code.
